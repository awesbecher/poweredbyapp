Hi ${clientName},

Your AI Email Agent has been successfully set up!

Here's what happens next:
âœ… Your agent will now monitor the inbox at **${agentEmail}**  
âœ… It will reply to customers using GPT-4, based on your company knowledge  
âœ… You can approve, edit, or reject replies from your admin dashboard  

ðŸ‘‰ **Dashboard Login:** [Launch Your Agent](${dashboardUrl})

Want to improve responses? Just upload more docs to the knowledgebase â€” the agent will learn instantly.

If you need help or want to add more inboxes, reply to this email anytime.

Welcome to the future of customer support ðŸš€  
â€“ The Powered_by Team`;
